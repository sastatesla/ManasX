## 🚀 What Makes ManasX Different

Unlike traditional linters that focus on syntax, ManasX understands your **organizational context** and helps maintain consistency as your codebase evolves. It's designed for the AI era where code is generated by humans and AI assistants working together.

### ✨ Key Differentiators

- **🧠 Pattern Learning**: Automatically learns your codebase's established patterns
- **🤖 AI Detection & Auditing**: Identifies and applies special rules to AI-generated code  
- **⚡ Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous governance monitoring, not just PR checks
- **🔌 AI Tool Integration**: Feeds organizational context to Cursor, Claude Code CLI, and other AI assistants
- **📊 Enterprise Reporting**: Organization-wide compliance dashboards and metrics

## 🏗️ Core Capabilities

### 🎯 **Continuous Code Governance**
```bash
# Start real-time monitoring
manasx watch src/
# → src/components/Button.js 2 critical, 1 high
# ● eval() usage is prohibited for security reasons :42
# ● Synchronous file operations block the event loop :18
```

- **Real-time violation detection** as you code
- **Clean CLI interface** - only shows what matters
- **Severity-based alerts**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Silent monitoring** for clean files (zero noise)

### 🧠 **Organizational Pattern Learning**
```bash
# Learn your codebase patterns
manasx learn src/
# ✓ Analyzed 847 files, learned 23 patterns
# ✓ Naming conventions, import styles, architecture patterns detected
```

- **Automatic pattern detection** from existing codebase
- **Naming convention learning** (camelCase, kebab-case, etc.)
- **Import style analysis** (relative vs absolute paths)
- **Architecture pattern recognition** (component structure, file organization)

### 🤖 **AI Code Detection & Auditing**
```bash
# Detect AI-generated code
manasx ai-detect src/ai-component.js
# ◉ AI-generated code detected (87.3% confidence)
# ● Missing human review comment
# ● No unit tests for AI-generated code
```

- **AI pattern recognition** (GPT, Claude, Copilot signatures)
- **Confidence scoring** with detailed evidence
- **Special auditing rules** for AI-generated code
- **Human review requirements** for critical AI code

### 🏢 **Enterprise Rule Engine**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "security/require-company-fetch": {
      "severity": "high",
      "message": "Use companyFetch instead of raw fetch",
      "description": "All API calls must use the company fetch wrapper"
    },
    "security/no-eval": {
      "severity": "critical",
      "message": "eval() usage is prohibited",
      "autofix": false
    }
  }
}
```

- **Custom organizational rules** beyond standard linting
- **Contextual enforcement** (company-specific requirements)
- **Exception management** with justification and expiry
- **Configurable severity levels** and auto-fix options

### 📊 **AI Tool Integration & Context Feeding**
```bash
# MCP server for AI assistants
manasx mcp-server --port 3001
# ✓ Context server running - AI tools can now access organizational patterns
```

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server for AI tool integration
- **Real-time context feeding** to Cursor, Claude Code CLI
- **Organizational knowledge sharing** with AI assistants
- **Violation history** and compliance insights for AI tools

### 📈 **Enterprise Monitoring & Reporting**
```bash
# Generate compliance dashboard
manasx status
# 📊 ManasX Governance Dashboard
# 📁 Files Monitored: 1,247
# 🚨 Active Violations: 23 (3 critical, 8 high, 12 medium)
# 🤖 AI Code Detected: 156 files (12.5%)
# ⏱️ Monitoring Uptime: 2d 14h 32m
```

- **Organization-wide metrics** and compliance scoring
